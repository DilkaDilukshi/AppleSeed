# Why AppleSeed as the name?

Our Applet or App (APP-le, get it?) is the foundation of our code, it is designed around SpringBoot. We believe in letting you code on this framework will be awesome, Apples grow into a huge tree during the Spring. 



# Introduction
This is the base for the API which is built on AppEngine Standard with Java 8 using SpringBoot.

## Contributors

## Available Tools:
- Custom Exceptions built on top of Springboot
- GAE Tools by [3wks](https://github.com/3wks)

## Security Tokens
Security Tokens are automatically generated upon load with the username `user`, for example:
``` 
[INFO]
[INFO] Using default security password: 712c1aa7-d7b6-4364-a4ac-a19c5aa47f3d
[INFO]
```

Therefore you can do a HTTP Request with username:password
for example:
```
user:712c1aa7-d7b6-4364-a4ac-a19c5aa47f3d
```
